",2023-03-01 16:55:19,BRANDON. LOVE,"I’ve had spectrum/time Warner Wi-Fi for over decade. It’s been okay. I’ve only had their cellular phone service for almost one year.  I’m a stay at home wife and it mostly works fine at home off my Wi-Fi in the house But it barely works when I’m out and about.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. I can’t count on it. If I’m out doing errands and I need to use the search or pull up an email it sometimes will and sometimes won’t. The map and the weather usually always work off my data but apps, email, websites, it’s very inconvenient. I had the same problem with my last provider that’s why I switched. Before that I had Verizon and they for sure were the best but way too expensive. Before that back, in the day I used Cricket and they were actually really good. The only reason I left them was because I started traveling and they didn’t have as many towers back then, that’s why I went to Verizon but nowadays all cell providers have plenty of towers. Yes it was a thing. Only the big companies like Verizon ATT Sprint, not sure if they’re still around, they were the big companies that had the best cellular coverage and the most towers. 
Anyway, I don’t know why it doesn’t work good outside my home Wi-Fi range.  It’s caused me a few issues now because I needed it to work when I was away from home and it didn’t and yes I made sure that cellular was turning on.",3,False,Spectrum Cellular
1,,,,2023-03-03 00:26:01,samross19,"First of all, if you’re forced to get Spectrum as your wifi, I’m sorry. I was 18 when I first moved to my apartment for college and had to set up Spectrum WiFi. They gave us a router that was 4 generations outdated. It caused our WiFi to go in and out for 2 years. We were able to connect any devices other than laptops and phones to it, which doesn’t seem bad but we had multiple gaming devices that wouldn’t connect either. After two years, the old router finally went out and wouldn’t come back online. After MULTIPLE hours of talking to spectrum about fixing it on our end, they finally said we could bring it in to a store and replace our router for a new one. At 10pm after 24 hours without WiFi (mind you there are 4 college students living here who have work, class, and hw online) we replaced our router for a new one that was multiple generations ahead of what they had given us. We were so angry that they put us through it. We never complain about customer service, but this is the worst experience we’ve ever had. Scammers all around. Not only that, but during storms they will send storm warnings and give you links to check your area, but the links are never accurate and will never take you where you want to go. F spectrum all around.",1,False,Spectrum app and service is a scam

The history I could write would take another 26 hours but since I’m NOT being paid (or even credited) for
doing THEIR technician job, I’ll spare you.  Before you get suckered in, check out Alta Fiber or other competitors locally. They were a massive improvement over Time Warner when they purchased it and now, it’s the worst service I’ve ever received and ironically, the most expensive - and - it’s mostly supposed to be entertainment. It costs MORE than my Gas and Electric bill which btw, RARELY goes out and they never ask me, the customer, to self-install unsolicited new upgraded equipment (that ultimately doesn’t work!)

3,,,,2023-01-08 06:20:22,roy william g,"Spectrum is really a poor quality service that don’t tell their customers or keep the customers update then they take their customers free rights away on what kind of router can be installed and who has control which in all aspects those says it should be left me to Port forward nodded some app. There is no security issue with it. They just want to keep a eye on you and that’s how they do because they let anybody know I can get into any IP address regarding the Internet when I was speaking to a representative on the phone they said every network I had on my line that’s kind of crazy and I shouldn’t be asked for why I need a port set up. Questions should be asked that app does not always give me guaranteed to hit port select because it’s grayed out.

4,,,,2023-01-05 04:38:41,Precise23,"First off I was on the phone line with a agent for over 2hrs. I was trying to disconnect my spectrum tv services. I explained to her I have no need for the service and was paying to much. She negotiated with me for over 1hr and did her best to convince me. At the end everything sounded great. I agreed to her lies. She told me to wait 24 to 48hrs to see the adjustment, she told me everything would stay the same. The only thing that would change would be the price. When I finally looked at the updated statement, I noticed that she added us a landline that we never approved or agreed to. She also added us to a program that she never told us about after that came to find out that we were going to pay more than what she had told us. At the end I called back, spoke to a supervisor. He tried making the adjustments and wasn’t able to. I’ve been a loyal customer for over 8yrs. It’s sad to say goodbye.",1,False,Worse customer service

Their support is garbage.   I don’t blame the agents but their exec management. Had multi day outages and zero detail they could provide.  No updates over time just complete and utter silence.  Clearly they don’t have a grasp on Service Management. Back to the app - click any of the buttons and it leads to a phone number.  Want to upgrade service - call, want to add service - call.   Why show me an option which is of zero use.  I mean there isn’t much folks need to do in an app tied to the service other than update or change plans so why not make it available I. App.   Honestly have zero interest talking to an agent.  The internet service itself isn’t horrible but their inability to provide reasonable updates on outages which are of increasing frequency is pushing us to look elsewhere.",1,False,Basically worthless app

Deciding not to stay with AT&T, or go to T-Mobile like I was planning to do is the worst decision I’ve made where mobile service is concerned. I live NEAR DOWNTOWN ORLANDO, and not out in the middle of the woods, but with the way my service is always slow, always throttled, you’d think I do. I ABSOLUTELY REGRET HAVING SPECTRUM MOBILE, and as soon as I can pay off in full the iPhone that they regularly turn into an brick for me, I am going to T-Mobile where their plans are actually GENEROUS for the money that you pay them.

It was a little hard for me to find any real use with the phone that I already had cause I don’t have any interlinking from the company to the phone seeing how the other beneficiaries of the income that they’re receiving from me by paying a monthly plan and I cannot unlock my phone I did not give me a working telephone number for my tablet so that I can make phone calls plainly because I’m just a customer I could be with the initials in my name it could be anything but they wouldn’t do anything for me and that’s just that there’s nothing to me,2,False,Apple tablet iPhone 14

However, being a satellite company, whenever the weather is bad, you can count on Directv to go out!
I guess you get what you pay for, but it would be nice if Spectrum would change their recording boxes so that you could record more shows at one time.
