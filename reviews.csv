Warrior1960,Used to be a good app and company,Unfortunately this year Charter/Spectrum has become a sad joke. I used it exclusively for internet services and it’s damned frustrating to only be able to login on my laptop a couple times per month at best.

firemark,Worst ever new system setup,"I have owned SimpliSafe systems for many years and many properties.  I recently bought another property and ordered a new system.   This was the most frustrating installation setup process I’ve ever encountered.   
The last system I bought a little over two years ago was quite easy, plug in the base, turn on the keypad and the system and keypad walked you through the setup step by step for each device.
NOT NOW!  The ONLY way to set up your system is through their App.  Try to use the Keypad to add devices and it tells you to use hr App. What’s worse, the process is poorly designed and very slow to respond.  I started with entry sensors which normally are very uncomplicated devices.  You’re told to click to type of device in the App then press the small button on the device.  Of course you first have to get it out of the tiny box, unwrap it from the plastic, peel off the backing for the adhesive tape and mount it all before you touch that button.   Guess what happens when you accidentally touch the button multiple times during all this?   It starts adding the same sensor multiple times!  Somehow it also decides to make up device serial numbers that don’t correspond with anything you have.  Worse, there is no going Back in the App.  No navigation to the prior step.  Your only way to fix this is go to keypad, hit the Menu button, enter your master code then delete the erroneous or unnamed devices.   Remember I mentioned starting with Entry Sensors?  I had to stop and get the keypad activated before continuing just to fix this mess.
Of course this happened multiple times while unpacking and mounting the sensors.
On top of that, once I setup a Motion Sensor, mounted it and named it, the App shows it as “Unknown “ device in the Livingroom.
Guess where the only way to fix that exists?
No not the Keypad, Not the App on your phone, The regular Web Browser for SimpliSafe!  
What should have been a 30 minutes install process for 6 entry sensors and a motion sensor took over two hours.
Finally, when you get to the Monitoring service setup, your ONLY option is their highest priced level in a 30 day trial.  You can’t make any changes or selections even though you’re a current customer with multiple systems paying for monitoring!

Wendy in Wisconsin,Clueless customer service,"I’ve been trying to get help for two weeks.  Billing , technical support,
Customer service.  All are separate services and they just keep passing you on to another service and you have to explain over and over again.  If while you are talking to them and the call drops they can’t call out to call you back.  Then you try to call back to finish the conversation and you can’t talk to the person you were talking to.  Guess what?  You have to start all over again with a new person.  I bet if they look at the notes they took down while talking to me they’ll see I was passed on to 6-9 people .  Spectrum is great for Internet but are clueless to think they can run a successful mobile company!  I need to get this straightened out so I have a phone that actually can work.  One representative told me today that they began mobile service in 2018.  That’s 5 years ago.  Give it up spectrum because we spread the word and you’re losing all of us.",Clueless customer service,"I’ve been trying to get help for two weeks.  Billing , technical support,

Martha4415,My grandparents have never had internet since they bought their home in 1954,"I was out shopping and for some reason the Spectrum store really drew my attention. I stepped in, signed up and 15 minutes latter I had a same day appointment for a first time installation. I did this for my grandparents they  where never much of internet, iPads , computers, and sill have a S5 Iphones….
The spectrum technician Lee was on time. It took him by himself every bit of three hours to install cable from the electricity poll to the house. I felt so bad it was in the middle of June and the temperature was in the three digits. He never complained just smiled and assured my wide eyed grandparents the job would get done by 6pm.  He currently did complete the job on time. The then local channels only tv was transformed into a RUKO smart TV and Pluto Cinema.  
They are slowly progressing over to other applications. But the look on their faces was all made possible by the staff and of course Spectrum.
