I was having issues with both the Spectrum TV app and the MySpectrum app.  I was chatting with “Jonathan” via the chat feature on their website because the MySpectrum app wouldn’t load at all.  The representative was troubleshooting the issues and was unable to resolve anything.  He kept stating there was an issue with our internet which I know there wasn’t as I work from home full time utilizing our home internet and I’d had zero issues.  He asked if I could check if any other devices were having issues and I told him my husband doesn’t have the app so I didn’t know.  He then told me he needed to schedule a technician to come out to which I replied no thank you because this is an app issue not an internet issue.  As I’m chatting with him, my husband gets a text and email stating the contact settings have been changed to his information.  Mind you, I am the account owner and my husband was added afterwards as optional when he moved in.  My husband doesn’t even have the app to change anything and I couldn’t access the app to change anything.  So “Jonathan” apparently didn’t like that he couldn’t resolve my issue and didn’t like that a woman is the account owner with my information being the main contact so he changed it to my husband’s email and phone number.  I ended the chat then noticed on their website, there is an app outage."

I stepped in, signed up and 15 minutes latter I had a same day appointment for a first time installation. I did this for my grandparents they  where never much of internet, iPads , computers, and sill have a S5 Iphones….
The spectrum technician Lee was on time. It took him by himself every bit of three hours to install cable from the electricity poll to the house. I felt so bad it was in the middle of June and the temperature was in the three digits. He never complained just smiled and assured my wide eyed grandparents the job would get done by 6pm.  He currently did complete the job on time. The then local channels only tv was transformed into a RUKO smart TV and Pluto Cinema.  
They are slowly progressing over to other applications. But the look on their faces was all made possible by the staff and of course Spectrum.  Thank you  for catching them up to the 21st century… or at least some of it. Thanks for reading !"

I pay for 500Mb internet but could only get about 125Mb on a good day. I figured out that the modem they sent me was not capable of 500mb speeds. So I felt ripped of and switch my provider, well I tried to switch but they wouldn’t let me cancel. I told customer service I did not want any promotion deals because I already have my new internet provider set up. “All I want is to cancel”, And they just kept trying to sell me crap and trying to convince me to cancel with my other provider. I’m an not exaggerating that it took me about an hour to cancel my account, and I talked to a total of 3 different people. I was getting frustrated at this point, during this ordeal I kept hearing the person I was on the phone with giggling like it was a joke and her chattering with people in the background. 

0/10 will never use again"

Choose a different provider if you have the option,"I’ve had spectrum for about two years now, as that is the only provider available at my apartment complex. I STILL have not had a full day of my internet working. When it does “work” it’s either slow as molasses, or will just disconnect from everything and reconnect ALL ON ITS OWN in about 5 minutes, which I’d argue is worse than it just not working at all. When I go to my mothers house on the other side of town, the Internet won’t reach any room that is not the living room (where the router and modem are). They have had dozens of techs come out and even upgraded their package for stronger internet that works even WORSE than the cheaper option. If I could give negative stars I really would. Don’t bother calling spectrum unless you want the run around or be told “move somewhere else so you can get better reception”. All the tech did was look at things we already looked at and told us things WE TOLD THEM. Really, really bad service."

Billing , technical support,
Customer service.  All are separate services and they just keep passing you on to another service and you have to explain over and over again.  If while you are talking to them and the call drops they can’t call out to call you back.  Then you try to call back to finish the conversation and you can’t talk to the person you were talking to.  Guess what?  You have to start all over again with a new person.  I bet if they look at the notes they took down while talking to me they’ll see I was passed on to 6-9 people .  Spectrum is great for Internet but are clueless to think they can run a successful mobile company!  I need to get this straightened out so I have a phone that actually can work.  One representative told me today that they began mobile service in 2018.  That’s 5 years ago.  Give it up spectrum because we spread the word and you’re losing all of us."

I have only one complaint and that is once a week for the month I’ve had service with them I have to unplug and restart my modem and router and wait about 10 minutes for everything to load up and get back to working in proper fashion. Other than that I have no issues and the people I’ve talked to on customer service a couple of times have been super friendly and knowledgeable and able to answer all my inquiries to satisfaction. I only wish I wasn’t locked into cricket on my phone plan for 6 months bcz spectrums bundle of home internet and phone service is way more affordable than my phone plan with one company and internet thru another.

The app is next to useless, meaning it’s impossible to use. Everything glitches and at least once a week I am having major issues just using the Wi-Fi. Haven’t messed with the router or the modem, they stay in the same spot. Yet somehow even after going untouched there’s always something wrong with it. I pay $95 a month for possibly the worse internet service possible. Spectrum needs to up their game cause this is not the move what do ever. 1 more wifi shot off away from losing a customer. Fix your app and fix your service. The only reason I’m even giving spectrum a star is purely because I I can’t right the review without doing so. Half of a star is more than generous. That is all."

Setup Spectrum after we discussed in EXACT detail the arrangement I wanted to accommodate my second home being there sometimes and away other times. Chose lying corrupt Spectrum because they happily deceived me into signing up only to later tell me the temporary service suspensions didn’t work the way I was lied to. Again nothing was unclear at all - I made sure to give specific details and they deliberately lied to me. I am done for life and will leave this review in a few places. Such short sighted corrupt jerks. You should be thoroughly ashamed. Disgusting. You never think about the long term consequences or lifetime value of a customer before lying to them like this? All calls are recorded for quality control. Can all calls be sent to the FTC so they can evaluate your dishonesty?
8,,,,2023-06-09 16:56:42,Alice83,2,False,A shoddy app from a horrible ISP,"Spectrum, née TWC, is an awful company that actively spends the money we pay them to lobby for consumer and internet hostile policies. Their antipathy towards their customers is evident across this app. There is no working copy/paste or autofill for entering payment details (so you’ll need to hand type all your credit card information) and the lack of Apple Pay and other payment options shows how little they care. The “Spectrum WiFi” profile installation process is broken as well (tested on both iPhone and iPad). The only things working fully seem to be the self service support features (which reduces Spectrum’s phone support costs). In summary, this app is focused on saving Spectrum’s time/money, not yours."

I have been going through 30 gigs of data and have no clue what has changed as far as why I’m using so much data but they have begun throttling down the speeds and cellular survices once I go past 30 gigs which is their “unlimited plus” plan this is the same thing all the other company’s have done in the past which led to me going to spectrum. This wasn’t the case with spectrum before and it shouldn’t be now. to me an unlimited plan should truly be unlimited no matter what you’re charging for it if I sign up for an unlimited plan, I should get unlimited anything and everything that is included in that plan. I suggest Spectrum fix this, or they’re going to start losing business."

i have some things that really need to be addressed with the app. I hope a fix can come soon. 

(1) When you managing devices and viewing your device list, there is ablity to create a pause schedule. but there is NO ability to remove a pause schedule!! please add this ability its common sense to have a remove feature if you have a add feature. 

(2) addtionally with pause schedules, please add the ability to create more then one schedule for any one device

(3) add a feature that allows you to create a notification when a specific device is being used. (connected doesnt mean its being used by a person, so this would have to be based on the amount of network activity the device is having. 

These are great features and tool to have. i hope to see them soon. the family desperate needs them, thanks you :)"

Random outages during the day with no explanation. Impossible to work from home and not miss important meetings. All they told me is “they’re upgrading equipment for summer, you can go work at one of the places with a spectrum hotspot.” No way. Not a solution. After three times in one week I switched to ATT fiber and have not had a single issue in months. Also, spectrum will raise your bill, or try to bundle you with a bunch of crap you don’t need every year. I hate this company and hope goes down like the dumpster fire it truly is. :)"

If you do end up paying for their services, where many places like apartments force you to do, you will still get 2-3 calls a day from spam spectrum shilling other useless products.

The app on top of this steaming pile of **** hardly ever works, double charges your cards, and is perhaps the most unintuitive user experience ever designed.

They seem to be hyper greedy at the expense over you and everyone else they serve. Don’t expect good internet, service, or ease of use.

Do your best to get another internet provider like Starlink or AT&T. Anything is better than the conniving internet provider known as Spectrum."
