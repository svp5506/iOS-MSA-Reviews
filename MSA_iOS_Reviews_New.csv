(3) add a feature that allows you to create a notification when a specific device is being used. (connected doesnt mean its being used by a person, so this would have to be based on the amount of network activity the device is having.

The spectrum technician Lee was on time. It took him by himself every bit of three hours to install cable from the electricity poll to the house. I felt so bad it was in the middle of June and the temperature was in the three digits. He never complained just smiled and assured my wide eyed grandparents the job would get done by 6pm.  He currently did complete the job on time. The then local channels only tv was transformed into a RUKO smart TV and Pluto Cinema.  
They are slowly progressing over to other applications. But the look on their faces was all made possible by the staff and of course Spectrum.  Thank you  for catching them up to the 21st century… or at least some of it. Thanks for reading !"

The person on the phone said they couldn’t help me and I had to go through the website/app. The app won’t load my billing and the website states that they have my credit card information and will bill it in a few days, but I keep getting calls and texts stating my bill is past due. Do better spectrum, do better."

I have been going through 30 gigs of data and have no clue what has changed as far as why I’m using so much data but they have begun throttling down the speeds and cellular survices once I go past 30 gigs which is their “unlimited plus” plan this is the same thing all the other company’s have done in the past which led to me going to spectrum. This wasn’t the case with spectrum before and it shouldn’t be now. to me an unlimited plan should truly be unlimited no matter what you’re charging for it if I sign up for an unlimited plan, I should get unlimited anything and everything that is included in that plan. I suggest Spectrum fix this, or they’re going to start losing business."
