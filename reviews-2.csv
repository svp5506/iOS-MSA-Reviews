itsZETIMEtoPARTY!!!!!!!!!!!,The worst service,"I would avoid spectrum at all costs. They couldn’t even keep the internet working. Random outages during the day with no explanation. Impossible to work from home and not miss important meetings. All they told me is “they’re upgrading equipment for summer, you can go work at one of the places with a spectrum hotspot.” No way. Not a solution. After three times in one week I switched to ATT fiber and have not had a single issue in months. Also, spectrum will raise your bill, or try to bundle you with a bunch of crap you don’t need every year.

Josanni B,Terrible Service. Choose a different provider if you have the option,"I’ve had spectrum for about two years now, as that is the only provider available at my apartment complex. I STILL have not had a full day of my internet working. When it does “work” it’s either slow as molasses, or will just disconnect from everything and reconnect ALL ON ITS OWN in about 5 minutes, which I’d argue is worse than it just not working at all. When I go to my mothers house on the other side of town, the Internet won’t reach any room that is not the living room (where the router and modem are). They have had dozens of techs come out and even upgraded their package for stronger internet that works even WORSE than the cheaper option. If I could give negative stars I really would. Don’t bother calling spectrum unless you want the run around or be told “move somewhere else so you can get better reception”. All the tech did was look at things we already looked at and told us things WE TOLD THEM. Really, really bad service.",Terrible Service.

TheRealAldo,Sexist customer service reps,"I’ve been a Spectrum customer for almost 20 years (they were Insight before being bought by Charter).  I was having issues with both the Spectrum TV app and the MySpectrum app.  I was chatting with “Jonathan” via the chat feature on their website because the MySpectrum app wouldn’t load at all.  The representative was troubleshooting the issues and was unable to resolve anything.  He kept stating there was an issue with our internet which I know there wasn’t as I work from home full time utilizing our home internet and I’d had zero issues.  He asked if I could check if any other devices were having issues and I told him my husband doesn’t have the app so I didn’t know.  He then told me he needed to schedule a technician to come out to which I replied no thank you because this is an app issue not an internet issue.  As I’m chatting with him, my husband gets a text and email stating the contact settings have been changed to his information.  Mind you, I am the account owner and my husband was added afterwards as optional when he moved in.  My husband doesn’t even have the app to change anything and I couldn’t access the app to change anything.  So “Jonathan” apparently didn’t like that he couldn’t resolve my issue and didn’t like that a woman is the account owner with my information being the main contact so he changed it to my husband’s email and phone number.
