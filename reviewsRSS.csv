My grandson could finally play games with his besties that live in a different state.  There was a mixup with mine and my neighbors address.   Spectrum deleted  my account at the wrong address and started me with a new account  at my correct address.  I don’t know what happened but now we get internet  maybe half the time. It’s very frustrating when the page won’t load and says I’m not online. I’ve called several times and I’m told everything is working like it should and my phone does show 3 bars. We have AT&T  and I thought maybe they were having a problem  but then I realized my grandson’s game doesn’t use AT&T. The game has to go through the internet. So I’m paying for something that only connects 1/2 the time. Unfortunately we are rural so we really don’t have many other choices for internet. I was so hopeful!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=942608209&type=Purple%20Software,0,Application,0

I recently bought another property and ordered a new system.   This was the most frustrating installation setup process I’ve ever encountered.   

The last system I bought a little over two years ago was quite easy, plug in the base, turn on the keypad and the system and keypad walked you through the setup step by step for each device.

NOT NOW!  The ONLY way to set up your system is through their App.  Try to use the Keypad to add devices and it tells you to use hr App. What’s worse, the process is poorly designed and very slow to respond.  I started with entry sensors which normally are very uncomplicated devices.  You’re told to click to type of device in the App then press the small button on the device.  Of course you first have to get it out of the tiny box, unwrap it from the plastic, peel off the backing for the adhesive tape and mount it all before you touch that button.   Guess what happens when you accidentally touch the button multiple times during all this?   It starts adding the same sensor multiple times!  Somehow it also decides to make up device serial numbers that don’t correspond with anything you have.  Worse, there is no going Back in the App.  No navigation to the prior step.  Your only way to fix this is go to keypad, hit the Menu button, enter your master code then delete the erroneous or unnamed devices.   Remember I mentioned starting with Entry Sensors?  I had to stop and get the keypad activated before continuing just to fix this mess.

Of course this happened multiple times while unpacking and mounting the sensors.

On top of that, once I setup a Motion Sensor, mounted it and named it, the App shows it as “Unknown “ device in the Livingroom.

Guess where the only way to fix that exists?

No not the Keypad, Not the App on your phone, The regular Web Browser for SimpliSafe!  

What should have been a 30 minutes install process for 6 entry sensors and a motion sensor took over two hours.

Finally, when you get to the Monitoring service setup, your ONLY option is their highest priced level in a 30 day trial.  You can’t make any changes or selections even though you’re a current customer with multiple systems paying for monitoring!

Try calling Customer Service for technical support?  Stuck on hold over 15 minutes  with no indication anyone is actually working support on a Saturday afternoon.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=942608209&type=Purple%20Software,0,Application,0

I pay for 500Mb internet but could only get about 125Mb on a good day. I figured out that the modem they sent me was not capable of 500mb speeds. So I felt ripped of and switch my provider, well I tried to switch but they wouldn’t let me cancel. I told customer service I did not want any promotion deals because I already have my new internet provider set up. “All I want is to cancel”, And they just kept trying to sell me crap and trying to convince me to cancel with my other provider. I’m an not exaggerating that it took me about an hour to cancel my account, and I talked to a total of 3 different people. I was getting frustrated at this point, during this ordeal I kept hearing the person I was on the phone with giggling like it was a joke and her chattering with people in the background.

Haven’t messed with the router or the modem, they stay in the same spot. Yet somehow even after going untouched there’s always something wrong with it. I pay $95 a month for possibly the worse internet service possible. Spectrum needs to up their game cause this is not the move what do ever. 1 more wifi shot off away from losing a customer.

(1) When you managing devices and viewing your device list, there is ablity to create a pause schedule. but there is NO ability to remove a pause schedule!! please add this ability its common sense to have a remove feature if you have a add feature. 

(2) addtionally with pause schedules, please add the ability to create more then one schedule for any one device

(3) add a feature that allows you to create a notification when a specific device is being used. (connected doesnt mean its being used by a person, so this would have to be based on the amount of network activity the device is having.

I stepped in, signed up and 15 minutes latter I had a same day appointment for a first time installation. I did this for my grandparents they  where never much of internet, iPads , computers, and sill have a S5 Iphones….
The spectrum technician Lee was on time. It took him by himself every bit of three hours to install cable from the electricity poll to the house. I felt so bad it was in the middle of June and the temperature was in the three digits. He never complained just smiled and assured my wide eyed grandparents the job would get done by 6pm.  He currently did complete the job on time. The then local channels only tv was transformed into a RUKO smart TV and Pluto Cinema.  
They are slowly progressing over to other applications. But the look on their faces was all made possible by the staff and of course Spectrum.

Again nothing was unclear at all - I made sure to give specific details and they deliberately lied to me. I am done for life and will leave this review in a few places.

When I go to my mothers house on the other side of town, the Internet won’t reach any room that is not the living room (where the router and modem are). They have had dozens of techs come out and even upgraded their package for stronger internet that works even WORSE than the cheaper option. If I could give negative stars I really would.

I have all my devices set up for my home WiFi but Spectrum keeps disconnecting my home WiFi to connect me to a hot spot from Spectrum mobile. My WiFi and streaming continues to go on and off by itself. When it does this my home WiFi gets kicked off of all my streaming devices. Therefore making my streaming devices slow, or buffering, or looping. I then have to re-connect with my home WiFi back to all my streaming devices that are registered on my home WiFi network.

I was having issues with both the Spectrum TV app and the MySpectrum app.  I was chatting with “Jonathan” via the chat feature on their website because the MySpectrum app wouldn’t load at all.  The representative was troubleshooting the issues and was unable to resolve anything.  He kept stating there was an issue with our internet which I know there wasn’t as I work from home full time utilizing our home internet and I’d had zero issues.  He asked if I could check if any other devices were having issues and I told him my husband doesn’t have the app so I didn’t know.  He then told me he needed to schedule a technician to come out to which I replied no thank you because this is an app issue not an internet issue.  As I’m chatting with him, my husband gets a text and email stating the contact settings have been changed to his information.  Mind you, I am the account owner and my husband was added afterwards as optional when he moved in.  My husband doesn’t even have the app to change anything and I couldn’t access the app to change anything.  So “Jonathan” apparently didn’t like that he couldn’t resolve my issue and didn’t like that a woman is the account owner with my information being the main contact so he changed it to my husband’s email and phone number.
