",2023-03-01 16:55:19,BRANDON. LOVE,"I’ve had spectrum/time Warner Wi-Fi for over decade. It’s been okay. I’ve only had their cellular phone service for almost one year.  I’m a stay at home wife and it mostly works fine at home off my Wi-Fi in the house But it barely works when I’m out and about.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. I can’t count on it. If I’m out doing errands and I need to use the search or pull up an email it sometimes will and sometimes won’t. The map and the weather usually always work off my data but apps, email, websites, it’s very inconvenient. I had the same problem with my last provider that’s why I switched. Before that I had Verizon and they for sure were the best but way too expensive. Before that back, in the day I used Cricket and they were actually really good. The only reason I left them was because I started traveling and they didn’t have as many towers back then, that’s why I went to Verizon but nowadays all cell providers have plenty of towers. Yes it was a thing. Only the big companies like Verizon ATT Sprint, not sure if they’re still around, they were the big companies that had the best cellular coverage and the most towers. 
Anyway, I don’t know why it doesn’t work good outside my home Wi-Fi range.  It’s caused me a few issues now because I needed it to work when I was away from home and it didn’t and yes I made sure that cellular was turning on.",3,False,Spectrum Cellular

I was having issues with both the Spectrum TV app and the MySpectrum app.  I was chatting with “Jonathan” via the chat feature on their website because the MySpectrum app wouldn’t load at all.  The representative was troubleshooting the issues and was unable to resolve anything.  He kept stating there was an issue with our internet which I know there wasn’t as I work from home full time utilizing our home internet and I’d had zero issues.  He asked if I could check if any other devices were having issues and I told him my husband doesn’t have the app so I didn’t know.  He then told me he needed to schedule a technician to come out to which I replied no thank you because this is an app issue not an internet issue.  As I’m chatting with him, my husband gets a text and email stating the contact settings have been changed to his information.  Mind you, I am the account owner and my husband was added afterwards as optional when he moved in.  My husband doesn’t even have the app to change anything and I couldn’t access the app to change anything.  So “Jonathan” apparently didn’t like that he couldn’t resolve my issue and didn’t like that a woman is the account owner with my information being the main contact so he changed it to my husband’s email and phone number.  I ended the chat then noticed on their website, there is an app outage.",1,False,Sexist customer service reps

They gave us a router that was 4 generations outdated. It caused our WiFi to go in and out for 2 years. We were able to connect any devices other than laptops and phones to it, which doesn’t seem bad but we had multiple gaming devices that wouldn’t connect either. After two years, the old router finally went out and wouldn’t come back online. After MULTIPLE hours of talking to spectrum about fixing it on our end, they finally said we could bring it in to a store and replace our router for a new one. At 10pm after 24 hours without WiFi (mind you there are 4 college students living here who have work, class, and hw online) we replaced our router for a new one that was multiple generations ahead of what they had given us. We were so angry that they put us through it. We never complain about customer service, but this is the worst experience we’ve ever had. Scammers all around. Not only that, but during storms they will send storm warnings and give you links to check your area, but the links are never accurate and will never take you where you want to go. F spectrum all around.",1,False,Spectrum app and service is a scam

I stepped in, signed up and 15 minutes latter I had a same day appointment for a first time installation. I did this for my grandparents they  where never much of internet, iPads , computers, and sill have a S5 Iphones….
The spectrum technician Lee was on time. It took him by himself every bit of three hours to install cable from the electricity poll to the house. I felt so bad it was in the middle of June and the temperature was in the three digits. He never complained just smiled and assured my wide eyed grandparents the job would get done by 6pm.  He currently did complete the job on time. The then local channels only tv was transformed into a RUKO smart TV and Pluto Cinema.  
They are slowly progressing over to other applications. But the look on their faces was all made possible by the staff and of course Spectrum.  Thank you  for catching them up to the 21st century… or at least some of it. Thanks for reading !",4,False,My grandparents have never had internet since they bought their home in 1954

They were a massive improvement over Time Warner when they purchased it and now, it’s the worst service I’ve ever received and ironically, the most expensive - and - it’s mostly supposed to be entertainment.

5,,,,2023-07-26 22:08:58,EvanGsix,"Spectrum does not have customer service they just have sale reps that try to sell you stuff instead of fixing your problems, my problem was that they secretly increased my price by 20 dollars and constantly kept down throttling me. I pay for 500Mb internet but could only get about 125Mb on a good day. I figured out that the modem they sent me was not capable of 500mb speeds. So I felt ripped of and switch my provider, well I tried to switch but they wouldn’t let me cancel. I told customer service I did not want any promotion deals because I already have my new internet provider set up. “All I want is to cancel”, And they just kept trying to sell me crap and trying to convince me to cancel with my other provider. I’m an not exaggerating that it took me about an hour to cancel my account, and I talked to a total of 3 different people. I was getting frustrated at this point, during this ordeal I kept hearing the person I was on the phone with giggling like it was a joke and her chattering with people in the background.

When it does “work” it’s either slow as molasses, or will just disconnect from everything and reconnect ALL ON ITS OWN in about 5 minutes, which I’d argue is worse than it just not working at all. When I go to my mothers house on the other side of town, the Internet won’t reach any room that is not the living room (where the router and modem are). They have had dozens of techs come out and even upgraded their package for stronger internet that works even WORSE than the cheaper option. If I could give negative stars I really would. Don’t bother calling spectrum unless you want the run around or be told “move somewhere else so you can get better reception”. All the tech did was look at things we already looked at and told us things WE TOLD THEM. Really, really bad service.",1,False,Terrible Service. Choose a different provider if you have the option

Guess what?  You have to start all over again with a new person.  I bet if they look at the notes they took down while talking to me they’ll see I was passed on to 6-9 people .  Spectrum is great for Internet but are clueless to think they can run a successful mobile company!  I need to get this straightened out so I have a phone that actually can work.

They just want to keep a eye on you and that’s how they do because they let anybody know I can get into any IP address regarding the Internet when I was speaking to a representative on the phone they said every network I had on my line that’s kind of crazy and I shouldn’t be asked for why I need a port set up. Questions should be asked that app does not always give me guaranteed to hit port select because it’s grayed out.

I recently moved and thought I was going to transfer my services, but checked out Spectrum offers. Not only was Spectrum $30 cheaper, they also had the BEST customer service. There were no extra fees, I was able to get my service on the same day, and everyone I spoke to was extremely nice. 

When I told AT&T I wanted to cancel, they tried to offer me more speed at the same price, but Spectrum was still more affordable. When I mentioned this, they got a bad attitude and became very short with me. All to say, I’m thrilled to be a Spectrum customer!",5,False,AT&T can’t compare

Other than that I have no issues and the people I’ve talked to on customer service a couple of times have been super friendly and knowledgeable and able to answer all my inquiries to satisfaction.

I explained to her I have no need for the service and was paying to much. She negotiated with me for over 1hr and did her best to convince me. At the end everything sounded great. I agreed to her lies. She told me to wait 24 to 48hrs to see the adjustment, she told me everything would stay the same. The only thing that would change would be the price. When I finally looked at the updated statement, I noticed that she added us a landline that we never approved or agreed to. She also added us to a program that she never told us about after that came to find out that we were going to pay more than what she had told us. At the end I called back, spoke to a supervisor. He tried making the adjustments and wasn’t able to. I’ve been a loyal customer for over 8yrs. It’s sad to say goodbye.",1,False,Worse customer service
12,,,,2023-08-02 02:16:21,Patty Wade,The 1st month with Spectrum internet was great. It worked perfect.  My grandson could finally play games with his besties that live in a different state.  There was a mixup with mine and my neighbors address.   Spectrum deleted  my account at the wrong address and started me with a new account  at my correct address.  I don’t know what happened but now we get internet  maybe half the time. It’s very frustrating when the page won’t load and says I’m not online. I’ve called several times and I’m told everything is working like it should and my phone does show 3 bars. We have AT&T  and I thought maybe they were having a problem  but then I realized my grandson’s game doesn’t use AT&T. The game has to go through the internet. So I’m paying for something that only connects 1/2 the time. Unfortunately we are rural so we really don’t have many other choices for internet. I was so hopeful!,1,False,So disappointed!

Their support is garbage.   I don’t blame the agents but their exec management. Had multi day outages and zero detail they could provide.  No updates over time just complete and utter silence.  Clearly they don’t have a grasp on Service Management. Back to the app - click any of the buttons and it leads to a phone number.  Want to upgrade service - call, want to add service - call.   Why show me an option which is of zero use.  I mean there isn’t much folks need to do in an app tied to the service other than update or change plans so why not make it available I.

JM",2023-07-30 05:16:33,firemark,"I have owned SimpliSafe systems for many years and many properties.  I recently bought another property and ordered a new system.   This was the most frustrating installation setup process I’ve ever encountered.   

The last system I bought a little over two years ago was quite easy, plug in the base, turn on the keypad and the system and keypad walked you through the setup step by step for each device.

NOT NOW!  The ONLY way to set up your system is through their App.  Try to use the Keypad to add devices and it tells you to use hr App. What’s worse, the process is poorly designed and very slow to respond.  I started with entry sensors which normally are very uncomplicated devices.  You’re told to click to type of device in the App then press the small button on the device.  Of course you first have to get it out of the tiny box, unwrap it from the plastic, peel off the backing for the adhesive tape and mount it all before you touch that button.   Guess what happens when you accidentally touch the button multiple times during all this?   It starts adding the same sensor multiple times!  Somehow it also decides to make up device serial numbers that don’t correspond with anything you have.  Worse, there is no going Back in the App.  No navigation to the prior step.  Your only way to fix this is go to keypad, hit the Menu button, enter your master code then delete the erroneous or unnamed devices.   Remember I mentioned starting with Entry Sensors?  I had to stop and get the keypad activated before continuing just to fix this mess.

Of course this happened multiple times while unpacking and mounting the sensors.

On top of that, once I setup a Motion Sensor, mounted it and named it, the App shows it as “Unknown “ device in the Livingroom.

Guess where the only way to fix that exists?

No not the Keypad, Not the App on your phone, The regular Web Browser for SimpliSafe!  

What should have been a 30 minutes install process for 6 entry sensors and a motion sensor took over two hours.

Finally, when you get to the Monitoring service setup, your ONLY option is their highest priced level in a 30 day trial.  You can’t make any changes or selections even though you’re a current customer with multiple systems paying for monitoring!

He said “ the way we do it is, Im gonna set you up a whole new account, BUT YOU HAVE YO PAY YOU OLD BILL, Mr Guthrie?!” I said yes.

4K for months now. I’ve gone back and forth with Spectrum regarding the issue to which they state it is not a Spectrum issue, but rather an Apple issue and/or Apple device. That is not the case! My issues are: When watching live TV only, as on demand networks works fine, every 5-10 minutes the channel will freeze, but the audio will continue running. When the channel refreshes, the audio is not synced to live real time viewing - there is a major lag. I have to constantly change the channel back and forth so I can continue watching live TV, which is frustrating. None of these issues occur while using other apps on AppleTV i.e. Netflix, Hulu, Peacock, etc. A Spectrum technician who visited my resident confirmed that the problem is not with my internet connection, speed, or my wireless network. They even replaced my modem and router. They did advise me that customers have been experiencing the same problem and it has everything to do with the Spectrum App. I've deleted and reinstalled the app on AppleTV several times with no luck. My AppleTV is fully up to date with the latest software. I also spoke to an Apple Care Technician who also stated it is not the Apple device, but the Spectrum App. The app is totally dysfunctional on AppleTV. Spectrum developers/engineers need to look into this issue and resolve it. As a paying customer, put your customers first and make the necessary changes. You are aware of the issue. Please don’t ignore it!",1,False,Spectrum App dysfunctional with AppleTV 4K
